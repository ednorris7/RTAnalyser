* [LibUsbDotNet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusbdotnet) is a .NET C# USB library for WinUsb, libusb-win32, and Linux libusb v1.x developers.

All basic USB device functionality can be performed through common device classes allowing you to write OS and driver independent code.

\## Known Issue

When the device is performing a measure the driver polls the device intermittently to record the experiment duration and say when the experiments done. If the device stops unexpectedly due to low battery, the FunctionStatus wonâ€™t report the BatteryTooLow error due to the nature in which you poll the device for an update on the measurement.
